# MicrosoftEngage2021
This repository is made by Ritikesh Vali as a submission for the Microsoft Engage 2021 Challenge

I used Agile Scrum Methodology while creating the Web App.
The task was divided into 3 sprints: 

• Design :
  Design of the App was made, from deciding to make a Web App, which APIs to use, to creating rough wireframe for the frontend.
  Learnt about WebRTC, PeerJS and other APIs required to establish a Real Time Peer-to-Peer connection.

• Build :
  Started creating the Web App with the minimum functionality as the first step, and adding extra features upon their testing along with reading Microsoft Teams' own documentation to know which features to include.

• Adapt :
  Added the additional functionality, i.e., a chatting area to the Web App for the participants to message.
